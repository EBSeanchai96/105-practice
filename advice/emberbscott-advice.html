                <h4>Computers are not newborns: be bold</h4>
                <p>Many of us start programming with little to no background, and learning all of the terminology, parts at play, logic, etc can be terrifying. Add the fear of losing your work and breaking your tools, and it's easy to become paralysed.</p>

                <p>Summon your courage: the odds of you messing something up beyond repair are not as high as you think they are, and the reality of doing so is not as scary as you think it is.</p>

                <h4>You must make mistakes in order to become a great programmer, and to develop the mindset so central to our bunch: I seem to be facing a problem; what will fix this problem?</h4>
                <p>Programming is a creative and highly rewarding pursuit, especially for those delight in the process. Remember to take deep breaths and breaks, especially when you feel you've hit a wall, solutions wise. Remind yourself that no great thing has been built with careless haste or without difficulty, and that you aim to create something you're proud of. Connect with fellow programmers, allow your relaxed thinking to take over for a bit, and come back to the project with confidence: you are surrounded with the resources to solve this problem. Your past mistakes are among those resources.</p>

                <p>Don't be afraid to mess things up, or to talk about those messes: talking about them will help you understand what to do next time, encourage your peers who may have similar problems, and who knows- you may come upon a better solution to a common problem, or think of a way to reduce that issue for everyone.</p>

                <p>This work will always be filled with obstacles and problems, some of which will be yours. Remember that learning to work with code is essentially donning the cap of "problem solver", and take setbacks in stride. You're training to be an expert in what you're doing right now: creating things that work and are beautiful, by implementing many solutions for many obstacles.</p>
